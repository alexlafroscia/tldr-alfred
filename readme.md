## FAQ

### Q: Why aren't there tests run through CI?

Apparently Alfred needs to be installed in the testing environment; I couldn't get it to work right in Travis CI. If you can help me with this, please let me know.

### Q: I'm getting an error about rate limiting? What's going on?

I noticed during development that after hitting their API repeatedly, Github started sending `403` responses. If you wait a bit, you should be able to make requests again.
